000003060_000010950.wav|poppy somerville believed in soulmates. call her crazy, or naive, or hopelessly romantic if you want she´d heard it all
000011070_000020700.wav|but ever since she sneaked her first drugstore romance novel to read under the covers at night, shed believed. that there was someone for everyone  a pot for every lid.
000020880_000023070.wav|a place her heart could find a home.
000038370_000044700.wav|its why, when she finally sat down to write her very own book, a love story was the only thing on her mind.
000044880_000052050.wav|now, a few years and half a dozen novels later, she had millions of readers all over the world because they wanted to believe, too.
000052470_000101140.wav|some people rolled their eyes, but poppy didn´t care. she figured there was something brave about that kind of hope, especially with so much darkness in the world.
000101290_000108160.wav|love was worth taking a risk on, no matter how easy it seemed just to play it safe and settle for something less than the one.
000108550_000116050.wav|so why did she have a tight knot in the pit of her stomach just thinking about the wedding that should have been happening twenty thousand feet below her right now?
000116470_000125230.wav|She could picture it perfectly she´d selected every detail. She knew the music that would have been playing, the white roses decorating the chapel pews.
000125380_000133810.wav|it was her dream wedding from start to finish—and it was all still just a dream. because she’d broken things off just two weeks before the ceremony.
000146410_000155650.wav|“don’t worry, it’s nearly over.”, poppy snapped her head around. the lady in the next seat paused her knitting and offered a sympathetic smile.
000155830_000204230.wav|“we’ll be landing soon. this is always a bumpy ride, those atlantic winds.”, poppy managed a faint reply.
000204380_000208460.wav|she was gripping the armrest so hard, her knuckles were turning white.
000220940_000228770.wav|the plane lurched, and poppy bit back a whimper. it was the turbulence, she told herself. definitely the flight.
000229190_000236150.wav|“do you want to try and take your mind off it?”, the woman asked, friendly. “i have a book you can read, if you’d like.”
000236570_000242690.wav|she rummaged in her purse, then pulled out a paperback. poppy recognized the cover in an instant.
000242840_000252530.wav|it was her first book—the one that had propelled her from beavering away at a tiny cubicle at a temp job in the city, to . . . beavering away in a tiny office in her apartment, instead.
000252710_000259220.wav|contrary to popular opinion, bestselling authors weren’t all jet-setting around the world to exotic locations.
000259460_000305550.wav|the advance on that book had barely paid off the last of her student loans and bought a good bottle of wine to celebrate.
000305730_000309690.wav|but still, toasting the deal that night, she’d never been prouder.
000309840_000319710.wav|and even though her deals had grown along with her readership, poppy knew that doing what she loved every day was the real prize. and sharing her stories with readers around the world.
000321030_000326130.wav|she took the book and pretended to look over the jacket, even though she knew every word by heart.
000326310_000336000.wav|bounced for joy when those first advance copies had arrived, holding it in her hand for the very first time. “are you enjoying it?”, she couldn’t help asking.
000336150_000345060.wav|she always loved to get reviews, no matter how hard she tried to stay away. yes,” the woman said promptly, and poppy glowed with pride.
000345210_000351960.wav|love all her books,” she continued. “she has a way of writing, you really feel the passion of the relationship.
000352170_000400120.wav|i bet her husband’s one in a million, to make her write like this.”, poppy came back down to earth with a bump that jolted more than the plane.
000400300_000409870.wav|she knew all her fans thought she was having breathless affairs, or settled with the man of her dreams, but the woman in seat 12b couldn’t have been further from the truth—especially now.
000410320_000419530.wav|luckily, before she could reply, the overhead announcement switched on. “ladies and gentlemen, we’re ready to make our descent into boston international.
000419710_000425980.wav|thank you for joining us on this flight, if you could stow all baggage, poppy let out a sigh of relief.
000426100_000430930.wav|she could see the city lights spread out below them now, still dark before sunrise.
000431050_000440650.wav|she’d only been able to get a midnight flight from new york at the last minute, she’d been in such a hurry to get out of town. “there you go.”, her companion smiled.
000440800_000447970.wav|almost made it! just a few bumps and we’ll be back on solid ground.”, poppy wished it could be so simple.
000448180_000457780.wav|when they disembarked at the gate and she switched her phone back on, she found a dozen text messages waiting for her—all of them marked with the capital letters of increasing urgency.
000458170_000506600.wav|don’t look at your messages. seriously – don’t look, banning you from facebook. (call me, i love you)
000506990_000512930.wav|her best friend, summer. poppy knew she meant well, but now there was no way she wasn’t going to look.
000513080_000522350.wav|she stepped back from the scrum at the baggage carousel and took a deep breath, bracing herself before she clicked through to facebook and saw the notifications waiting for her.
000522770_000530930.wav|congratulations, owen and poppy! poppy felt a weird out-of-body sensation, like she was looking at herself in another life.
000531050_000541040.wav|her inbox was full: best wishes from distant relatives and old co-workers and old grade-school classmates she hadn’t seen in twenty years. best of luck for your life together.
000541190_000550400.wav|here’s to a beautiful bride! in all the rush to cancel everything and make sure all their guests were notified, poppy hadn’t thought to update her social media profile.
000550580_000559580.wav|it was just the same as it had been two weeks ago, with her engagement photo beaming out from the front page and a wall full of excited wedding countdowns from her family.
000600000_000608280.wav|but the photo didn’t show the doubts whirling in her mind, even then. or the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach every time she looked at her engagement ring,
000608280_000613590.wav|picked out a wedding dress, and tasted cake samples with their moms cooing over every slice.
000613740_000622710.wav|it felt like the walls were closing in on her, crushing her with icy panic, until she’d woken up in a cold sweat and known without a doubt she couldn’t go through with it.
000622890_000627480.wav|she didn’t love owen, not the way she needed to if she was going to say those vows.
000627630_000636600.wav|and as much as she longed for a life with someone, building the kind of forever she wrote about every day, every instinct in her body was screaming at her, not this time.
000637080_000645450.wav|not this man. she guessed her instincts were right, because now the sinking feeling was gone—replaced by an epic black hole of guilt.
000645630_000650940.wav|it still made her sick with shame, remembering the look on owen’s face when she’d told him it was the end.
000701710_000710110.wav|aunt june would say she was being dramatic. she did, in fact, when she reached out and offered poppy a lifeline: her beach cottage on cape cod.
000710530_000719080.wav|“trust me,” june had said down the phone line, in her usual no-nonsense tone. “if you stick around, you’ll let them talk you back into it.
000719260_000726880.wav|you need a nice change of scenery. and don’t you have that book that needs finishing?”, poppy didn’t need reminding.
000727030_000731680.wav|even now, hauling her bags off the conveyer, her deadline loomed large.
000731860_000737110.wav|her already pushed three times, editor leaving panicked voicemails, black cloud of a deadline.
000737320_000741940.wav|the final book in her series, the installment all her readers had been waiting for.
000742090_000747730.wav|she’d been avoiding that blank page for weeks now, so aunt june’s offer couldn’t have come at a better time.
000747910_000754660.wav|she could shut herself away miles from all the drama, and focus on giving her readers the happily-ever-after they deserved.
000755110_000759370.wav|even if her own happily-ever-after seemed further away than ever before.
000802190_000808190.wav|it was still dark by the time poppy claimed her rental car (and an extra-large coffee) and hit the road.
000820400_000826010.wav|the miles disappeared in no time and the sky was turning pink as she crossed the sagamore bridge.
000826160_000834980.wav|it was the unofficial gateway to the cape, where the bicep of shoreline arced in a lazy curl against the mainland, and poppy could almost feel the change in the air.
000835160_000844550.wav|six lanes narrowed to just a sandy two-way road, and then suddenly, the sun lifted over the horizon, glinting through the lush green woods and glittering on the dark ocean.
000844760_000853190.wav|even though she had the car heater blowing on full against the early-morning chill, poppy wound down the windows to inhale a lungful of crisp, tangy sea air.
000853610_000855440.wav|it tasted like summertime.
000906690_000913050.wav|the last time she made this drive, she was curled in the backseat, her head in a book while her parents bickered up front.
000913230_000922200.wav|they told her it would be an adventure, a whole summer at aunt june’s, but she knew well enough they just wanted her out of the way so they could fight at full volume back home.
000922410_000931830.wav|as she stood on the porch and watched their car disappear back up the bumpy lane, she was surprised to hear june say, “ten bucks says they’ll be divorced by the time they come pick you up again.”
000932280_000934440.wav|poppy had stared at her in shock.
000934620_000943050.wav|all the things they didn’t talk about those days, the d-word was the biggie, something they tiptoed around like an elephant slap-bang in the middle of the house.
000943440_000953280.wav|june gave her a knowing look. “c’mon kid, you’re smarter than anyone, all those books you’ve been reading. it’ll be alright,” she added, patting poppy on the shoulder.
000953460_000955590.wav|some things weren’t meant to be,
001010410_001014700.wav| then that meant there was plenty that was.
001014850_001024030.wav|true love existed, and maybe her parents hadn’t found it with each other the first time around, but she had to believe it was still out there, for everyone. except you.
001024480_001031320.wav|she pushed away the whisper of doubt in the back of her head, and focused on finding the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it turn off the highway.
001031470_001034680.wav|she’d been up all night, and exhaustion was hitting hard.
001034860_001044130.wav|she had to force herself to keep her eyes open as she wound her way down past clapboard houses and white picket fences, bright with hydrangeas in the early morning sun.
001044340_001050640.wav|when she finally found the blue-shingled beach cottage sitting squarely at the end of the lane, she could have cheered out loud.
001051090_001100060.wav|poppy parked out front and grabbed her purse from the front seat. she had a suitcase in the trunk, but the only thing she needed right now was a soft mattress and sleep,
001100060_001108430.wav|so she fished the spare key from under the ceramic whale on the porch, let herself in, and crawled straight upstairs to collapse face-down on the nearest bed.
001108880_001116980.wav|she kicked off her shoes, buried her face in the nearest cool pillow, and let out a sigh of satisfaction. then the hammering began.
001120880_001126880.wav|fresh hell was this? poppy dragged herself over to the window and squinted at the morning sun.
001127060_001136270.wav|from there, she could see out into the side yard, to aunt june’s vegetable patch, and the riot of wildflowers trailing down to the shore—and the house next door.
001136720_001143530.wav|although, to be honest, calling it a house felt like an insult to other homes, ones with four solid walls and a roof.
001143710_001153100.wav|this was barely standing, stripped back to the frame and wide open to the elements. she could see into the back room, from the cords of raw wood stacked on the foundation,
001153100_001200810.wav|a tangle of power cords and equipment. and she could definitely hear everything inside, too. the banging got louder.
001201200_001211160.wav|please, she sent up a silent prayer. just let me have an hour or two of sleep. and then, like the gods of slumber were smiling down on her, the banging stopped.
001212630_001215900.wav|poppy collapsed back into bed and closed her eyes to—
001217520_001226190.wav|the high-pitched whine of a saw echoed through the window, followed by the screech of metal against metal. every one of the hairs on poppy’s skin stood on end.
001226580_001236270.wav|she leapt out of bed. she stormed downstairs and out through the yard. “excuse me!”, she called, approaching the house next door.
001237200_001243320.wav|the sawing cut out, and a moment later, a man strolled out onto the deck. “what’s all the racket?”
001243470_001251600.wav|he demanded, safety goggles pushed up over his head and a power drill in his hands. poppy stopped.
001251780_001300690.wav|even through her sleep-deprived anger, she could still register cornflower-blue eyes, and a strong jaw, and chiseled arms straining under that plain white t-shirt
001301890_001308940.wav|he asked again, scowling impatiently. “i’m kind of busy here.”, “i know, i heard,” poppy recovered.
001309090_001317820.wav|“every last hammer, in excruciating detail. do you know what time it is?”, she added, plaintive. the man glanced at his watch.
001318000_001326640.wav|“seven-oh-three,” he drawled. a sunday morning!”, poppy exclaimed. there rules or regulations about this kind of thing?
001326820_001335640.wav|some of us are trying to sleep.”, “oh yeah, late night was it?”, the man arched an eyebrow and gave her a head-to-toe smirk that made poppy flush.
001335790_001344040.wav|she knew she must look a mess, in sweatpants and an old ball shirt with a stain from where the flight attendant had spilled cheap red wine during a bumpy patch.
001344310_001352170.wav|she smoothed down her tangled hair and straightened up. “i just got in on a red-eye. i’m staying at my aunt’s, right next door.”
001352410_001401140.wav|“june said something about that.”, he hoisted some wood over to the workbench. “but then, you always did like to boss everyone around, right pipsqueak?”
001401560_001409240.wav|hearing her old nickname triggered a sense of déjà vu. there was only one person who’d ever called her that, even when it drove her crazy.
001409420_001417220.wav|especially when it drove her crazy. she asked, blinking in disbelief. “the one and only.”
001417340_001425800.wav|he gave her a lazy grin, and even with stubble on his jaw and a smudge of sawdust on his cheek, that smile still wiped all her anger from her mind.
001426070_001432640.wav|“the last time i saw you, you were, she managed to recover in time. that was saying something.
001432820_001442810.wav|she remembered a gangly kid, constantly tormenting her with bugs and boogers and lord knows what else. now, cooper nicholson was all man. “how have you been?”
001442990_001447100.wav|she asked, still stunned. “what are you doing these days?”
001448450_001457690.wav|i stayed around town, started a business fixing up old houses,” he replied, then gave her a look. “at least, when i don’t have nosy neighbors interrupting me.”
001457930_001504290.wav|“i’m sorry,” poppy exhaled. just been travelling all night, and i’m so tired i could cry.
001504440_001511580.wav|is there any chance you could keep it down, just for a couple of hours?”, cooper seemed to soften.
001512960_001521690.wav|he disappeared back into the house, and poppy tried to catch her breath. who knew cooper, spitball king of sweetbriar cove, would grow up to be so .
001523610_001533360.wav|after a moment, cooper emerged with something in his hand. “sorry about the noise.”, he flashed her a wide, easy smile. “this should take care of it.”
001533600_001536450.wav|poppy looked down. earplugs.
001536840_001546470.wav|the man had kept her up, taunted her, and now presented her with two tiny knobs of bright orange foam like that was any help at all. “you’re not going to keep the noise down?”
001546470_001555620.wav|she asked, exhausted. “sorry, pipsqueak,” he said, sounding anything but apologetic. “just count yourself lucky you got a lie-in today.
001555770_001604920.wav|usually my crew starts at six!” cooper nicholson watched poppy hightail it back across the yard. she was pissed, he could tell. pissed, and cute as hell.
001605340_001613950.wav|he remembered her from the summer she’d spent at her aunt’s. back then, she’d been a tiny thing, with bright red glasses almost bigger than her face.
001614100_001618120.wav|not that you ever saw it, she was too busy with her nose stuck in a book.
001618330_001628110.wav|she could be out on the beach, surrounded by ballgames and playful dogs, and a dozen splashing kids, and nothing would ever shake her fascination with whatever she was reading that day.
001628290_001637800.wav|and to a mischievous ten-year-old like cooper, that was like waving a red rag in front of a bull. he chuckled, remembering all the ways he tried to distract her.
001637980_001646650.wav|most of them involving spider crabs, seaweed, and spitballs. no wonder she gave him such an icy glare when he called her by her old nickname, “pipsqueak.”
001646830_001651990.wav|but what could he say? something about poppy somerville made him want to get under her skin.
001652440_001702190.wav|he turned back to the workbench and started sawing again, but this time, he felt a twinge of guilt. she looked like she hadn’t slept in a week—but he was on a schedule here.
001702370_001709840.wav|she couldn’t just come waltzing over and demand he put all his plans on hold for her to get some beauty sleep. not that she needed it.
001709990_001715000.wav|even stressed, stained, and sleep-deprived, poppy still looked effortlessly beautiful.
001715150_001724960.wav|she must have hit a growth spurt somewhere along the way, because she sure wasn’t a scrawny little girl anymore. the saw hit the bracket with a screech. focus.
001725320_001734800.wav|he was barely a few weeks into this project, and had another month left, at least. more if the dry weather didn’t hold and they got their usual spring rainstorms.
001734980_001743740.wav|he knew the house didn’t look like much now, but under the sawdust and rotting shingles, there were great bones, and he was determined to restore it to its former glory.
001744160_001750640.wav|the historic houses along the cape had started out a hobby, but it had grown into a thriving business for him.
001750910_001800570.wav|most developers wanted to tear the older homes down and use the prime ocean-front plots to build new, modern mansions, but cooper had always loved the history in buildings like this.
001800720_001808820.wav|he studied old craftsman techniques and researched the original materials, and soon the word spread about his skill and classic architectural designs.
001809000_001817970.wav|when a reporter from new england quarterly had featured him in an article about historic preservation, his phone had started ringing off the hook and hadn’t stopped yet.
001818390_001822830.wav|but this project was special. he’d had his eye on the house for years.
001834920_001841460.wav|a classic colonial saltbox, it was built in the 1800s and was one of a disappearing breed on the cape.
001903450_001910980.wav|the view alone was worth a million dollars: nothing like the gentle curve of the bay and the sparkling blue ocean stretching out to the horizon.
002013260_002020940.wav|which meant he was working weekends, up at dawn, and keeping on right through to sundown, no matter who was trying to get some sleep next door.
002022680_002032520.wav|cooper reluctantly shut off the saw. poppy had looked exhausted, and besides, he’d been meaning to head into town to pick up supplies before the stores closed early.
002032670_002039060.wav|the noisy work could wait, for a couple of hours, at least. never say he wasn’t a generous guy.
002039450_002043590.wav|he grabbed the keys to his truck and drove the winding lane back towards town.
002043800_002049650.wav|he was practically a resident at the hardware store these days, and hank had everything he needed for once.
002050040_002058770.wav|“they say there’ll be rain by next week,” the old owner warned him, as he totaled up cooper’s supplies. “i’d get that roofing done sooner rather than later.”
002059070_002107500.wav|“that’s the plan,” cooper agreed. “how are you finding the siding?”, “still think you should be using the original shingles?”
002107740_002113290.wav|“remember termites,” another regular, larry, pitched in. he paused by the register.
002113440_002119920.wav|“those little bastards are lurking everywhere, especially older wood like that.”, it was always like this.
002120040_002129670.wav|you couldn’t stop by hank’s without a debate about everything from wood to the weather. “your pop knew all about termites,” larry added. “didn’t he make up a special paint?”
002129760_002133510.wav|cooper nodded. “my dad knew all about a lot of things.”
002133660_002140890.wav|it’s how he learned most of the tricks of his trade—those summers in high school working right alongside his pops on contracting jobs.
002141040_002148210.wav|at the time, he’d wanted to be anyplace else, but looking back now, he wished he’d appreciated that time together when they still had it.
002148510_002157840.wav|“before i forget,” hank added, “keep an eye out for june’s niece, won’t you? she said she’s arriving today.”, “already here,” cooper replied.
002157990_002203600.wav|“came in off a red-eye and stormed straight over to ask me to keep it down.”, men chuckled.
002203750_002212840.wav|“sounds like she takes after her aunt,” hank said, and cooper would have sworn he saw a twinkle in his eye. “we’re under strict instructions to make the girl feel welcome.”
002213140_002223130.wav|“well, she’s more than welcome to come pitch in with construction,” cooper joked. you said, there’s rain coming.”, he headed back outside and loaded up the truck.

002316830_002324060.wav|he even took over bill’s contracting jobs to keep the money coming in, watching as his dad’s good days got further and fewer in between,

002328830_002334380.wav|after that, cooper had thought about leaving again for a big city, but it never had the same appeal.

002403840_002411520.wav|he was so deep in memories that when he saw a flash of blonde hair up ahead, it felt like he was back there again. he caught his breath.

002416530_002423760.wav|a tide of regret slammed through cooper, the same guilt and shame that hit whenever he was reminded about the biggest failure of his life.
002423910_002430270.wav|then she lifted her head, and he realized it was a stranger he’d never seen before. he exhaled.
002430450_002437320.wav|he was gripping the steering wheel so tightly, his knuckles were white. cooper yanked the wheel around and pulled over to park.
002437770_002443050.wav|it looked like his new neighbor was getting her beauty sleep after all. he needed a drink.

002458560_002507140.wav|she slept all day, and by the time she’d enjoyed an epic hot shower and unpacked her things in the pretty guest bedroom, she felt just about human again.
002507590_002517430.wav|and hungry. she couldn’t even remember the last time she’d eaten, her stomach had been tied up in knots during the flight, and before that . . . some chips from a vending machine, maybe?
002517850_002525170.wav|either way, she needed sustenance, and fast. she pulled on her jeans and a sweater, then headed off into town on foot.

002559220_002607620.wav|set in a hollow, mid-way up the cape, sweetbriar had been settled by early english colonists—at least according to the town historical society.
002607800_002613440.wav|she hadn’t been back in twenty years, but poppy was pleased to find everything exactly as she remembered.

002621750_002628650.wav|she could even swear it was the same flyers advertising the spring fling literary festival peeling in the grocery store window,
002628650_002633000.wav|and the same calico cat perched on a fencepost outside the hardware store.
002633210_002639270.wav|on closer inspection, there were some new improvements—a chic art gallery tucked next to franny’s gift shoppe,
002639270_002646050.wav|a new coffee shop she mentally bookmarked for her morning cup of joe—but the true spirit of sweetbriar was still alive and well.
002658830_002708550.wav|she ducked inside. it was a homey pub, with traditional wooden beams, old black-and-white nautical photographs on the walls, and a big fireplace across the room.
002708880_002717160.wav|she made a beeline for the bar, which was being tended by a scruffy, surfer-looking man with tousled blond hair. “is it really the best on the cape?”
002717340_002727270.wav|she asked, nodding to the menu. “according to big pete,” he said. “and he’s the only authority we need.”, still around?”
002727300_002728710.wav|poppy exclaimed.

002745150_002754990.wav|really, i think the town hall voted on it last year.”, poppy laughed, just as a familiar voice came from behind her. “flirting again, riley?
002755140_002804380.wav|you should know, pipsqueak here doesn’t like boys. we’ve all got cooties.”, poppy turned, and found herself staring into cooper’s teasing blue eyes again.
002804620_002813380.wav|she felt a flush—then immediately scolded herself. “only some of them,”, she said with a glare. “and can you please stop calling me that?”
002813650_002823250.wav|“sleep well?”, he asked, undaunted. “no thanks to you.”, she heard a chuckle, and when poppy turned back, she found the bartender looking amused.
002823490_002831590.wav|“friend of yours?”, he asked cooper. “she wouldn’t put it like that,” he said. this is riley,” he introduced them.
002831800_002841640.wav|riley gave her a wink, and cooper let out a snort. “don’t mind the smooth talk,” he told poppy. “he flirts with everything that moves.”, “excellent.”
002841670_002850670.wav|poppy smiled, just to get a rise out of him. “i haven’t flirted with anyone in forever.”, riley smirked.
002850850_002859100.wav|“i like this one. he asked her, and won her undying affection. at least someone had priorities.
002859340_002904380.wav|“all of the above,” poppy answered, and he gave a salute. “coming right up.”
002904500_002912570.wav|riley disappeared in to the back, and cooper slid easily onto the stool beside poppy. “so how’s life as a big-shot romance author?”
002915840_002918660.wav|poppy realized. should have guessed.”
002918780_002928620.wav|she remembered the time her aunt came to visit—and then proceeded to move all her books to the front section of the store, proudly telling everyone within earshot that her niece was the bestseller.
002928800_002938190.wav|poppy loved her enthusiasm, just wished it wasn’t quite so . . . public. “tell me she doesn’t brag too much,” she said, just imagining what the town must think of her.
002938490_002945450.wav|cooper gave her a sideways look. “it depends if you classify sending out a town newsletter about your new book ‘too much.’
002945630_002952770.wav|she told everyone to keep an eye out for you this week. i’m surprised she didn’t make us roll out the ticker-tape and put on a parade.”
002952950_003002550.wav|he tossed another peanut up in a lazy arc and caught it in his mouth. poppy, “so much for keeping a low profile.”, “in hiding, are you?”
003002820_003010020.wav|“something like that.”, she changed the subject fast. “what about you? i can’t believe it’s been so long.
003010230_003019110.wav|the last time i saw you, you were running around dropping seaweed down everyone’s shirts.”, “not everyone,” cooper corrected her. “just yours.”
003019380_003022680.wav|“gee, thanks.”, poppy gave him a sideways look.
003033660_003042900.wav|poppy dragged her gaze away. she shouldn’t be looking at anyone’s muscles, let alone the guy who’d made an art of tormenting her. new with you?”
003042930_003046560.wav|she asked instead. “wife, kids, white picket fence?”
003046980_003056010.wav|the smile slipped from cooper’s face, and poppy had a feeling she’d just said the wrong thing, but before he replied, riley returned with her beer, and another for cooper.

003107320_003116830.wav|“well, just so you know, my place is right upstairs. if you ever can’t make it home.”, riley gave her another wink. cooper grumbled beside her.
003117010_003125740.wav|“c’mon. now you’re just being desperate.”, “i like to think of it more as ‘charming’ and ‘irresistible,’, riley corrected him, and poppy couldn’t help but laugh.
003126010_003132340.wav|“thanks for the offer, but i’ll be sleeping in my own bed,” she said firmly. “for the foreseeable future.”

003140830_003150400.wav|“the queen of hearts hasn’t found her perfect soulmate yet.”, his words were light enough, but there was a sarcastic note in his voice that made poppy feel like he was mocking her.
003150700_003200120.wav|“not yet, no,” she replied, cooler this time. “yet you figure it’s your job to lecture everyone else on true love,” he said, and took a swig of his beer.
003201140_003210110.wav|don’t you think that’s kind of hypocritical?”, not lecturing anyone.”, poppy frowned, wondering how the conversation had suddenly taken a turn.
003210350_003218900.wav|“people are free to read whatever they want. i just write my stories.”, “full of happy endings and lightning strikes,” cooper challenged.
003219080_003227180.wav|“you ever think you’re setting them all up to fail? chasing after some big happy ending that’s never going to come their way?”, poppy paused.
003227330_003236630.wav|his words hit a nerve deep inside her, the same whispered doubts that kept her up at night, taunting her with the questions she wished she had an answer for. he was wrong.
003236840_003246230.wav|he had to be. otherwise everything she’d spent her life believing was a lie. “what’s it to you?”, she challenged him, trying to keep her cool.
003246410_003256340.wav|she felt weirdly vulnerable, raw wounds open for everyone to see. “have you even read one of my books?”, “i don’t need to,” cooper shrugged.
003256520_003303780.wav|“it’s all the same. building up some fantasyland of love and forever so people can’t help but be let down with the real world.
003303990_003313260.wav|you know, i feel sorry for the suckers who believe it, they don’t even realize what a scam they’re buying into. no offense,” he added, like an afterthought.
003313650_003322530.wav|he had to be kidding. poppy clenched her fists and got down from the stool. “where are you going?”, cooper asked, sounding confused.
003322830_003332670.wav|“well, you’ve just insulted me, my life’s work, and every woman who’s ever bought one of my books, so i figure i better get out of your hair. unless you want to start in on my mom?”
003332700_003340350.wav|poppy demanded. “my pastor? she turned on her heel and stalked across the bar.
003340530_003348690.wav|she would have walked out altogether if she hadn’t been so hungry, but as she sat down at a corner table, she was fuming. what the hell was his problem?
003349020_003355710.wav|she didn’t even know the guy, and he thought he could just dismiss her career as some kind of elaborate con on the readers of america.
003355950_003404260.wav|poppy was used to dealing with snobbery—you didn’t get to write romance without people looking down their noses at you—but,  usually that was easy to brush off.
003415900_003423310.wav|she’d stopped paying attention to those kinds of comments years ago, since she figured nothing would convince them that they were the ones missing out.
003423490_003432730.wav|sure, she wasn’t going to win any literary prizes, but that wasn’t the point. her readers didn’t come to her looking for the real world, they wanted an escape from it.
003432910_003441850.wav|a place to disappear in between school pick-up runs and double shifts at the hospital   a place where fate wasn’t cruel, hope won out, and love was never in vain.
003442300_003447700.wav|a place to believe. so poppy built that world for them—and for herself, too.
003447940_003456430.wav|no matter what else was happening in her life, she could guarantee that everything would work out in the end. at least, it did between the pages of her books.
003456580_003502880.wav|and this year in particular, her writing had been her main escape, as the juggernaut of her wedding barreled on towards “i do.”
003503420_003507230.wav|until the day she looked at her own words and realized if she married owen—if
003507230_003515420.wav|she settled for their life together—she would be giving up on everything she’d told her readers to fight for all these years. did he do this time?”
003515750_003523670.wav|riley’s voice cut through her thoughts, and poppy looked up to find him setting a plate of delicious-looking food in front of her. “sorry, what?”
003523700_003526310.wav|she asked, her mouth already watering.
003528560_003536720.wav|“i just saw him go storming out with a face like thunder, although, that’s just a normal sunday for him.”, poppy pressed her lips together.
003536870_003543230.wav|“just a small disagreement,” she said lightly, and riley snorted. “why am i not surprised?
003543410_003552230.wav|don’t take it personally,” he added with a sympathetic smile. love the guy like a brother, but he can be a grumpy asshole when he sets his mind to it.”
003552530_003600930.wav|“i’ll remember that. thanks, and for the food,” she said. “my pleasure.”, riley turned to go, but then poppy remembered something.

003609870_003617730.wav|“you’ll have to talk to him about that,” he said, as some new customers came in. “i better go. let me know if you need anything.”
003618240_003627840.wav|poppy watched him walk away. it sounded like she had touched a nerve with cooper without even meaning to, but even so, it didn’t give him the right to tear her down like that.
003628050_003638010.wav|maybe it wasn’t personal for him, but it sure felt that way. enough letting cooper nicholson get under her skin, she decided, and reached for a crisp, thick-cut fry.
003638160_003646860.wav|for some reason, he’d been in her face since the moment she’d arrived, but that didn’t mean she had to let him ruin her day. she was here for a reason, after all.
